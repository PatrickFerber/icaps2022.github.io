        </header>

        <p>Quantum Computing represents the next big step towards speed boost in computation, which promises major
          breakthroughs in several disciplines including Artificial Intelligence for the resolution of important classes
          of problems. Quantum algorithms process information stored in qubits, the basic memory unit of quantum
          processors, and quantum operations (called gates) are the building blocks of quantum algorithms. In order to
          be run on quantum computing hardware, quantum algorithms must be compiled into a set of elementary machine
          instructions (i.e., quantum gates). Since currently available quantum circuits suffer a number of
          technological problems such as noise and decoherence, it is important that the process that carries out the
          quantum computation be somehow adapted to the physical limitations of the quantum hardware of interest, by
          means of a proper compilation. This is the point in which AI-based P&S techniques can be of help to produce
          efficient compilation plans. On the other side, the speed-up promised by quantum technology may be greatly
          beneficial to solve P&S problems of more and more realistic size.</p>

          <h1>Outline</h1>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>We first provide an introductory part aimed at familiarizing the audience on the basics of quantum
            computing theory, focusing our attention on the so-called Quantum Alternate Operator Ansatz (QAOA)
            algorithms applied to the gate-model noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor units.</li>
          <li>We then proceed by analyzing a set of compilation algorithms based on AI-based optimization metaheuristics
            that can be tested on one of the publicly available quantum computing software development kits (e.g.,
            Qiskit - https://qiskit.org/), followed by a hands-on session in which the audience can run some
            exemplificatory code on the selected framework.</li>
          <li>Finally, we will provide some examples of how quantum circuits can be exploited to solve some types of
            scheduling problems (e.g., the Satellite Scheduling), terminating in a hands-on session in which the
            audience will test the presented algorithms.</li>

        <h2> Marco Baioletti</h2>
        <p>Marco Baioletti [M.S. Mathematics 1990, Ph.D. Statistical and Mathematical Methods for Economical and Social
          Research 1996] is an assistant professor at the University of Perugia since 2004. His research interests are
          focused on some areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular automated planning, probabilistic
          modelling and reasoning, metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization, neuro-evolution, quantum circuit
          compilation. He has published more than 70 papers, both in journals, book and peer-reviewed international AI
          conferences. He has been in the program committee of several international conferences (PPSN, EVO*, GECCO). He
          has recently participated to the study funded by the Ariadna program of the ESA "Meta-Heuristic Algorithms for
          the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem".</p>

        <h2>Angelo Oddi</h2>
        <p>Angelo Oddi [M.S. Electronic Engineering 1993, Ph.D. Medical Computer Science 1997] is a Senior Researcher of
          the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the Italian National Research Council (ISTC-CNR). His
          research work focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular planning & scheduling, constraint-based
          reasoning, learning and the design of autonomous systems for real-world applications. He has published more
          than 70 papers, both in journals, book and peer-reviewed international AI conferences. Dr. Oddi has been in
          the program committee of several international conferences (ICAPS, ECAI, AAAI, IJCAI) and was Conference Chair
          of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling 2013 (ICAPS-2013), Rome, June 10-14,
          2013. He participated in several national and international projects; in particular, he was national
          coordinator of the FIRB VISEL project (MIUR – Italian Ministry of Education University and Research – funds)
          aimed to develop a Deaf-centered E-Learning Environment (DELE). He has been involved in the realization of the
          MEXAR2 and RAXEM systems (2005-2012) dealing with the automatic generation of downlink/uplink plans for the
          European Space Agency (ESA) Mars-Express mission. Relatively to the MEXAR2 system, he acted as technical
          director and is still responsible for its maintenance (2014-2022). He has been the coordinator of the IMPACT
          project (Intrinsically Motivated Planning Architecture for Curiosity-driven roboTs) funded by ESA within the
          Innovation Triangle Initiative (ITI) 2017 program and recently held the position of head of the study funded
          by the Ariadna program of the ESA "Meta-Heuristic Algorithms for the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem".</p>

        <h2>Riccardo Rasconi</h2>
        <p>Riccardo Rasconi [M.S. Electronic Engineering 2003, Ph.D. Information and Communication Sciences and
          Technologies 2007] is a Research Scientist at ISTC-CNR. Riccardo has a long-term participation experience in
          national and international research projects, both from a Planning & Scheduling perspective and, more
          recently, from a ML perspective. Here is a very partial list, limited to the Space-related research projects
          only: Riccardo has been an active member of the ESA Project “GOAC (Goal Oriented Autonomous Controller)” ESA
          Project, about the development of an autonomous controller to provide increasing levels of autonomy for
          robotic task achievement. He is recently participating to the MEXAR2 Maintenance activity (an AI-based Tool
          for Continuous Support to Mission Planning). Moreover, he has recently participated to the ESA Study IMPACT:
          Intrinsically Motivated Planning Architecture for Curiosity-driven roboTs, that leveraged ML and Reinforcement
          Learning techniques to extend the autonomy capabilities of a robotic agent that explores the Martian surface.
          He has recently participated to the study funded by the Ariadna program of the ESA "Meta-Heuristic Algorithms
          for the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem". He has published over 48 research papers in Journals, Book
          Chapters and peer-reviewed Conference Proceedings in Computer Science, Planning & Scheduling, Constraint
          Reasoning.</p>
