        <p>The CraftBots simulation aims to be a new benchmark and competition environment for integrated planning and
          execution. Using a planning system effectively in the control of an agent acting in real-time poses a variety
          of challenges in integrating phases of planning with execution of plans. Integrated systems are developed with
          a focus on particular challenges, and it has been typically difficult to test, benchmark, and compare these
          systems. To do so requires a
          benchmark that has transparent and well-defined rules, and can be adapted to exhibit the problem
          characteristics of interest.</p>

        <p>Craftbots is an accessible (requiring only python3 and numpy) and adaptive benchmark simulation for
          integrated planning and execution. The simulation can be configured to present a wide variety of different
          scenarios and exhibit different problem features, such as temporal uncertainty, non-deterministic action
          outcomes, partial observability, and limited communications.</p>

        <p>In this tutorial we will guide participants through hands-on coding exercises during which participants will
          learn how to configure the scenario, implement a simple agent, and integrate the agent with the simulation
          API.</p>
