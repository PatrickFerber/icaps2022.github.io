        <h2>2022 Workshop on Deception Against Planning Systems and Planning in Adversarial Conditions (DAPSPAC)</h2>

        <p>
        An ICAPS'22 Workshop<br/>
        Singapore Management University, Singapore<br/>
        June 2022

<p>
  Fielded applications of planning must interact with a world that can be inexplicably hostile in unexpected ways. Game theoretic means of handling adversarial environments are both computationally expensive and impose their own assumptions which can be violated or exploited. This makes understanding how planning techniques react to provocations and false information a critical requirement for planning system deployments.
  The workshop will look at both sides of the problem &mdash; from characterizing attacks and vulnerabilities to proposed methods for detecting and mitigating threats.
  
</p>

<p>
  Topics of interest include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use cases and techniques for effective deception against planning systems</li>
  <li>Techniques for identifying and reacting to adversarial conditions</li>
  <li>Theoretical foundations and results for deception and robustness</li>
  <li>Analysis of robustness and stability of planning frameworks, including planning engines and corresponding knowledge models</li>
  <li>Validation and Verification of planning systems deployed in adversarial environment</li>
  <li>Relationships between game theory, automated planning, and applications of theory to planning system deployment</li>
  <li>Adversary modeling, both for evaluating the effect of deception on an actor and identifying adversarial inputs</li>
  <li>Applications of planning in adversarial conditions, e.g., cybersecurity operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission Information</h3>

<p>
  Authors may submit technical papers of up to 8 pages (+1 for references). We also encourage the submission of short papers (4+1) focussing on preliminary results, and challenge papers (2 pages) to discuss open problems. All submissions should be anonymized and conform to the <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip">AAAI style template</a>. The papers must be submitted in a PDF format via the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dapspac2022">EasyChair system</a>. Submissions will be reviewed by at least two referees.
</p>
<p>
  We welcome the presentation of relevant work published recently in archival conferences and journals. For these submission, please submit a short note pointing to the work and justifying its relevance. If the work is still under review, attach an anonymized copy. Already published work will not be included in the proceedings.
