<h3>Topics and Objectives</h3>

<p>
AI Planning &amp; Scheduling (P&amp;S) methods are key to enabling intelligent robots to perform 
autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviours. Researchers in the P&amp;S community have 
continued to develop approaches and produce planners, representations, as well as heuristics 
that robotics researchers can make use of. However, there remain numerous challenges 
complicating the uptake, use and successful integration of P&amp;S technology in robotics, many 
of which have been addressed by robotics researchers with novel solutions. Strong collaboration 
and synergy between researchers in both communities is vital to the continued growth of the fields 
in a way that provide mutual benefits to the two communities. To foster this, the PlanRob workshop 
aims to provide a stable, long-term forum (<a href="https://www.istc.cnr.it/en/content/planning-and-robotics">
having been held annually at ICAPS since 2013</a>) 
where researchers from both the P&amp;S and Robotics communities can openly discuss relevant issues, 
research and development progress, future directions and open challenges related to P&amp;S when 
applied to Robotics. In addition to the usual paper submissions, the workshop’s format naturally 
lends itself to preliminary results, position papers as well as to work focused on challenges in using 
and integrating planners in robotics systems.
</p>

<p>
To celebrate the tenth edition of this workshop at ICAPS, a special session will be organised to relive 
  past PlanRob editions, analyse the state of the art and discuss future scenarios. Chairs are also 
  planning for a thematic special issue in a relevant international journal.</p>

<p>
Example of typical topics for submissions in this workshop are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> real-world planning applications for autonomous and intelligent robots;
<li> optimising behaviour in large scale automated or semi-automated systems;
<li> integrated planning and execution in robotic architectures;
<li> planning domain representations for robotics applications;
<li> P&amp;S methods for optimisation and adaptation in robotics;
<li> mission, path, and motion planning for robots;
<li> planning and coordination methods for multi-robot teams;
<li> mixed-initiative planning and sliding autonomy for robotic systems;
<li> human-aware planning and execution in human-robot interaction;
<li> adversarial action planning in competitive robotic domains;
<li> formal methods for robot planning and control;
<li> challenges and solutions in using P&amp;S technology in robotics;
<li> open problems for P&amp;S in robotics,
<li> benchmark planning domains for robots.
</ul>
      
<h3>Submission Information</h3>

<p>
There are two types of submissions: short position papers and regular papers. 
Position papers are a maximum of four pages long while regular papers may be up 
to ten pages long. Papers may have an additional page containing references. 
Regular papers may be scheduled with more time in the final program. A poster session 
may be considered to provide a further presentation opportunity.
</p>

<p>
The guidelines for formatting are the same as is used for ICAPS 2022 papers (typeset in 
the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php">AAAI style template</a>), 
but with the AAAI copyright removed. The papers must be submitted in PDF format via the 
EasyChair system (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=planrob2022"
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=planrob2022</a>).
</p>

<p>
Please note that papers under review (e.g. which have been submitted to IJCAI-2022) are 
also welcome, however, in order to avoid potential conflicts, these manuscripts should be 
prepared as anonymous submissions for a double blind reviewing process.
</p>

<p>
Accepted papers will be published on the workshop’s website.
</p>

<p>
The organisers are investigating the availability of journal editors in order to invite a selection of accepted papers from the workshop to a special issue or post-proceedings volume.
</p>
