                    Planning is becoming a mature field in terms of base techniques and algorithms to solve goal-oriented tasks. It has been successfully applied to many domains including classical domains such as logistics or mars rovers, or more recently in oil and gas, as well as mining industry. However, very little work has been done in relation to financial institutions problems. Recently, some big financial corporations have started AI research labs and researchers at those teams have found there are plenty of open planning problems to be tackled by the planning community. For example, these include, trading markets, workflow learning, generation and execution, transactions flow understanding, risk management, fraud detection and customer journeys.
