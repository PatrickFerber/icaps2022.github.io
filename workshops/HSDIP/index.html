        <h2>2022 Workshop on Heuristics and Search for Domain-independent Planning</h2>

        <p>
        An ICAPS'22 Workshop<br/>
        Singapore Management University, Singapore<br/>
        June 2022
        </p>

<p>
  Heuristics and search algorithms are the two key components of heuristic search,
  one of the main approaches to many variations of domain-independent planning,
  including classical planning, temporal planning, planning under uncertainty and
  adversarial planning. This workshop seeks to understand the underlying principles
  of current heuristics and search methods, their limitations, ways for overcoming
  those limitations, as well as the synergy between heuristics and search.
</p>
<h3>Topics</h3>
<p>
  Examples of typical topics for submissions to this workshop are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>automatic derivation of heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning</li>
  <li>formal results showing equivalence or dominance between heuristics</li>
  <li>novel heuristic methods dealing with planning with numeric variables
  and effects, partial observability and non-deterministic action effects</li>
  <li>heuristic estimators for domain-independent planning via procedures or
  suitably defined encodings of declarative descriptions of planning tasks into
  Satisfiability or Optimisation</li>
  <li>novel search techniques for domain-independent planning that explicitly aim at
  exploiting effectively the properties of existing heuristics</li>
  <li>empirical observations of synergies between heuristics and search in
  domain-independent planning</li>
  <li>challenging domains for existing combinations of heuristics and search
  algorithms</li>
  <li>applications of machine learning in heuristic search, e.g., learning heuristics,
  adaptive search strategies, or heuristic selection</li>
  <li>interesting algorithmic optimizations for the calculation of a
  heuristic or the execution of a search</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The HSDIP workshop has always been welcoming of multidisciplinary work, for
  example, drawing inspiration from operations research (like row and column
  generation algorithms), convex optimization (like gradient optimization for
  hybrid planning), constraint programming, or satisfiability.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop is meant to be an open and inclusive forum, and we encourage papers
  that report on work in progress or that do not fit the mold of a typical
  conference paper. Non-trivial negative results are welcome to the workshop, but
  we expect the authors to argue for the significance of the presented
  results.
</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<h3>Submissions</h3>
<p>
  Please format submissions in AAAI style (see
  <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip">Author Kit</a>)
  and keep them to <b>at most 9 pages including references</b>. Authors
  considering submitting to the
  workshop papers rejected from the main conference, please ensure you do your
  utmost to address the comments given by ICAPS reviewers. Please do not submit
  papers that are already accepted for the main conference to the workshop.
</p><p>
  Submissions will be made through OpenReview:
  <a
          href="https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2022/Workshop/HSDIP">OpenReview</a>
</p>
<p>
  The workshop will be virtual. For each accepted
  paper, a 15 minutes video presentation has to be submitted which will be
  shown during the
  workshop and will be published on the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCALm3A1_zi-SIGKmaywIWXQ">
    HSDIP YouTube Channel</a>.
  At least one author of every accepted paper has to attend the workshop in
  order to answer questions.
</p>
