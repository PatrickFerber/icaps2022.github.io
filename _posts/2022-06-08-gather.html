            <h1>Gather Town Instructions</h1>



            <p>The preferred way of attending the conference is our virtual conference center on the Gather platform.
              All main-conference sessions, as well as workshops and tutorials, will be done in Zoom.</p>

            <p>Everything is accessible from inside gather.town. In particular, you can walk into sessions by entering
              one of the main track rooms, "Track A" and "Track B", just like you usually would. You can thus choose
              to spend the entire conference in Gather if you wish. The web page accompanies this with overview
              information
              as well as details on specific events.</p>

            <p>TODO elaborate a bit</p>

            <p>Workshops and Tutorials also have separate rooms in the gather.town space. Here is an assignment from
              event to room name:</p>

            <p>TODO event to room map from google doc</p>
