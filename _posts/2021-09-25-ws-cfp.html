        <p>The organizing committee of the 32nd International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS
          2022), currently scheduled to be held June 19-24, 2022 at Singapore Management University, invites proposals
          for its workshop program. The workshops provide a forum to discuss research advances on a selected topic in an
          informal setting and promote dissemination and collaboration on new planning and scheduling challenges.</p>

        <p>We welcome proposals from all areas of planning and scheduling. In particular, we encourage proposals that
          bridge other fields of research with planning and scheduling or that take a unique perspective on the ICAPS
          field.</p>

        <p>The workshop (and tutorial) programs will comprise several concurrent events held in the two days before the
          plenary sessions of the conference. Workshop registration is free for ICAPS participants.</p>

        <p>Similar to previous years, we encourage related tutorials and workshops to be co-proposed and co-run. Every
          effort will be taken to house related tutorials and workshops in the same venue.</p>

        <p>Ideally, workshops will be half a day in duration (not including possible associated tutorials), with
          exceptions made for workshops with historically high attendance and long programs. The workshop format is at
          the discretion of the individual organizers, and we welcome a mix of formats. Workshop organizers are
          encouraged to take initiatives that foster interaction and debate within the community. They also should be
          prepared to accommodate the possibility of ICAPS 2022 moving to a fully virtual (online) or hybrid (virtual
          and in-person) format.</p>



        <h3>Workshop Proposals</h3>

        <p>Workshop proposals should be no more than 3 pages long and should include the following sections:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Description</strong>: A description of the workshop topic.</li>
          <li><strong>Relevance to ICAPS</strong>: A brief discussion of why the topic is of interest to ICAPS at this
            time, and why the
            topic is not adequately addressed by other meetings or conferences.</li>
          <li>(optional) <strong>Tutorial Connection</strong>: If relevant, the title and speaker names for the tutorial
            to be attached
            to the workshop. A full tutorial proposal needs to be sent to the tutorial chairs (for details, see the
            separate call for tutorial proposals).</li>
          <li><strong>Format</strong>: A brief description of the proposed workshop length and format. Innovative
            formats that aim to
            increase opportunities for discussion and interaction are encouraged.</li>
          <li><strong>Diversity</strong>: A description of how the organizers plan to promote diversity in the proposed
            workshop (both
            from the organizational and attendee standpoint).</li>
          <li><strong>Organization</strong>: Names and full contact information for the organizing committee, plus short
            descriptions of
            their relevant expertise. Strong proposals include organizers who bring differing perspectives to the
            workshop topic and who are actively connected to the communities of potential participants.</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated Interest</strong>: An estimate of the number of workshop speakers (including invited
            speakers,
            presenters, panelists, etc.) and the expected number of workshop attendees. Optionally, a list of proposed
            attendees that have indicated potential (non-binding) interest.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>The organizers of accepted workshop proposals are responsible for:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Producing a Call for Papers (CFP) and contributing materials for setting up a web page for the workshop by
            1 February 2022. The web page and the CFP will be linked to the ICAPS 2022 website. Details on this process
            will be made available after notification.</li>
          <li>Additional publicity, such as distributing the CFP to relevant newsgroups and electronic mailing lists
            (through liaison with the ICAPS 2022 Publicity Chairs, Supriyo Ghosh and Christian Muise) and especially to
            potential audiences outside the ICAPS community.</li>
          <li>Organizing the review process for submissions and issuing invitations to participate in the workshop.</li>
          <li>Formulating a detailed technical program for the workshop and making it available to be uploaded on the
            ICAPS 2022 website well in advance of the conference. A list of accepted papers for the workshop should be
            ready to be placed on the workshop website by 15 April 2022.</li>
          <li>Compiling a camera-ready copy for the workshop proceedings in close interaction with the workshop program
            chairs. The workshop proceedings will be made available on the ICAPS 2022 website.</li>
