        <p>For this year's ICAPS, we want to organize a discussion forum to offer the possibility to talk about topics
          that are of interest to the community, but which are not typically represented during the conference.</p>

        <p>We allocated two time slots for the discussion sessions, to allow people from all time zones to join:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>June 23, 9pm (UTC)</li>
          <li>June 24, 8am (UTC)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The discussions will take place in Marina Bay room in the gather.town space.</p>

        <p>With these sessions, we intend to complement the discussion that is usually run during the ICAPS community
          meeting.
          The idea is to ask you, the community, for topics, align suggestions, and possibly join similar interests.
          The topics will then be discussed in small groups, allowing everyone who is interested to join.</p>

        <p>To keep the discussions somewhat organized, we will ask volunteers to moderate each table.
          Moderators will also be asked to summarize relevant outcomes of the discussions and report them to the ICAPS
          council.
          The council expressed their interest in this initiative and offered support for implementing suggestions that
          come out of the discussions.</p>


        <p>Possible topics include for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How to combine career and family?
          <li>How can I develop my career?</li>
          <li>What is the best way to deploy your planner?</li>
          <li>How to get your planner to real-world applications?</li>
          <li>How to make life easier for new people joining the community?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that the above list only serves as an example. These are not topics that will be discussed by default.
          If you are interested in one or more of the listed topics, please suggest to talk about them.</p>


        <h2>Submission</h2>

        <p>Please suggest topics, moderators, and your preferred time zone by email to:
          <a href="mailto:icaps22-discussion-topics@googlegroups.com">icaps22-discussion-topics@googlegroups.com</a>
        </p>

        <p>A simple informal mail in which you briefly describe the topic and your preferred time zone is good enough.
          If possible, please indicate a potential moderator (possibly yourself) along with a topic. Otherwise, we will
          try to look for moderators.</p>

        <p>Deadline is June 20 (AoE).</p>
