        <p>There is increasing interest in designing AI systems to complement and enhance, rather than supplant, human
          capabilities. New technical challenges arise in the development of machines that model and reason with the
          mental and physical state of human counterparts, and apply these models to collaborate with people in richer,
          more flexible ways. The Human-Aware Planning and Scheduling track welcomes research contributions on planning,
          scheduling, and decision support systems that account for, and fluidly interact with, the humans in the loop.
          We welcome all works that look at tackling any challenges inherent to settings where a person needs to use,
          interact, collaborate or work along with planning and scheduling systems. The submissions could include novel
          algorithms, novel-modeling techniques, challenge papers, case studies of fielded systems, and even novel and
          emerging applications. The track will also accept submissions that study the same challenges in the context of
          interaction with systems that use Reinforcement Learning or other learning methods for sequential decision
          making. We also encourage the authors to consider including user studies to validate novel algorithms or
          systems when appropriate. The topics for the special track include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Human-aware planning, scheduling, and execution</li>
          <li>Human monitoring, plan & goal recognition, and behavior prediction</li>
          <li>Mixed-initiative planning and scheduling systems</li>
          <li>Learning methods for planning in presence of humans</li>
          <li>Explanations of behavior in sequential decision-making/decision-support</li>
          <li>Explanation of scheduling/allocation decisions to human stake-holders</li>
          <li>Improving interpretability and explainability of AI planning/scheduling systems</li>
          <li>Generating predictable and interpretable behavior </li>
          <li>Methods for reward, goal, preference, or constraint specification for reinforcement learning agents </li>
          <li>Creating interpretable and adaptive user interfaces for planning/scheduling systems</li>
          <li>Proactive assistance and decision-support in human-AI collaborative scenarios</li>
          <li>Cognitive modeling, social interaction, and theory of mind</li>
          <li>Safety, ethics, fairness, and transparency in the context of planning/scheduling systems</li>
          <li>Representation and acquisition of human behavioral models</li>
          <li>Theories and applications of human behavior models</li>
          <li>Trust, communication, and collaboration in human-AI teams</li>
          <li>Benchmarking planning domains for human-AI interaction</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Important Dates</h3>

        <p>We have arranged our schedule to permit revision and resubmission of papers rejected from AAAI 2022.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>December 10, 2021</strong> - Abstracts due (electronic submission)</li>
          <li><strong>December 15, 2021</strong> - Full Papers due (electronic submission, PDF)</li>
          <li><strong>January 25-28, 2022</strong> - Author feedback period</li>
          <li><strong>February 18, 2022</strong> - Notification of acceptance or rejection</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in
          the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time!</p>

        <h3>Author Guidelines</h3>

        <p>Authors may submit long papers (8 pages AAAI style plus up to one page of references) or short papers (4
          pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated at submission time. All papers,
          regardless of length, will be reviewed against the standard criteria of relevance, originality, significance,
          clarity, soundness, and are expected to meet the same high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of
          narrower scope, for example by addressing a highly specific issue, or proposing or evaluating a small, yet
          important, extension of previous work or new idea. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.</p>

        <p>Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant unique content. Papers
          submitted to ICAPS 2022 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2022 review
          period nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals. AAAI
          decisions will be available two weeks before the ICAPS paper submission deadline. This year, the time gap
          between submissions to major AI conferences is tighter than usual. We had hoped to be able to both accept
          submissions of papers rejected from AAAI and enable authors to submit papers rejected from ICAPS to IJCAI
          2022.
          However, the timeline is simply too tight for us to do this and maintain the quality of the ICAPS reviewing
          process. So while rejected papers from AAAI will have decisions early enough to permit revision and
          resubmission
          to ICAPS, we are unable to complete our reviews in time for papers to be resubmitted to IJCAI. Specifically,
          as
          the ICAPS 2022 notification date is after IJCAI 2022 full paper submission dates, ICAPS authors will not be
          allowed to resubmit their papers to IJCAI while they are under review at ICAPS, because of single submission
          requirements of both conferences.</p>

        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

        <p>All submissions will be made electronically, through the EasyChair conference system:
          <a
            href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2022">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2022</a>
        </p>


        <p>Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the
          relevant
          track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the AAAI author kit instructions for formatting:</p>

        <p><a
            href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip">https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip</a>
        </p>

        <p>In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs,
          additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also
          anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider
          supporting
          material in their decisions.</p>
