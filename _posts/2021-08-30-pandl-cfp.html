        <p>The Planning and Learning track aims to present research at the intersection of the fields of machine and
          reinforcement learning with planning and scheduling. In particular, we are interested in work that draws
          substantially from the objectives, techniques, or methodologies of both fields.</p>

        <p>Topics include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

        <ul>

          <li> Reinforcement learning using planning (model-based, Bayesian, deep, etc.)</li>

          <li> Learning domain and action models for planning</li>

          <li> Representations for learned models in planning</li>

          <li> Learning effective heuristics and other forms of planning control knowledge</li>

          <li> Theoretical aspects of planning and learning</li>

          <li> Multi-agent planning and learning</li>

          <li> Planning applied to automating machine learning systems</li>

          <li> Learning to improve the effectiveness of planning &amp; scheduling systems</li>

          <li> Applications that involve a combination of learning with planning or scheduling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please note: papers that do not clearly make a case for their relevance to model-based planning techniques or
          that do not compare to model-based planning techniques may be rejected without review.</p>

        <h3>Important Dates</h3>

        <p>We have arranged our schedule to permit revision and resubmission of papers rejected from AAAI 2022.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>December 10, 2021</strong> - Abstracts due (electronic submission)</li>
          <li><strong>December 15, 2021</strong> - Full Papers due (electronic submission, PDF)</li>
          <li><strong>January 25-28, 2022</strong> - Author feedback period</li>
          <li><strong>February 18, 2022</strong> - Notification of acceptance or rejection</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in
          the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time!</p>

        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

        <p>All submissions will be made electronically, through the EasyChair conference system:
          <a
            href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2022">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icaps2022</a>
        </p>


        <p>Submitted PDF papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the
          relevant
          track CFP/submission type (long or short), and follow the AAAI author kit instructions for formatting:</p>

        <p><a
            href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip">https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip</a>
        </p>

        <p>In addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs,
          additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also
          anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider
          supporting
          material in their decisions.</p>
