        <p>The Organizing Committee for the 32nd International Conference on Automated
          Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2022) invites proposals for its Tutorial Program.
          Tutorials offer the attendees a review of a specific subfield by a leading
          expert. Participation in the tutorials is free for all ICAPS participants. ICAPS
          2022 will be take place in Singapore, June 19-24, 2022. Depending on the
          pandemic situation the conference might be partly or completely virtual.</p>

        <p>We welcome proposals in all areas related to AI planning and scheduling (P&S),
          and highly encourage topics that have not appeared in recent ICAPS tutorials. We
          accept both introductory tutorials, and more advanced tutorials covering recent advances
          in depth. We explicitly encourage proposals that address techniques of relevance
          to planning and scheduling, even if planning and scheduling is not the main
          focus of the proposed tutorial. Proposals could target, for example,</p>

        <ul>
          <li>relevant techniques in explainable AI for planning and scheduling,</li>
          <li>techniques that combine reinforcement learning and planning,</li>
          <li>planning and plan execution for multi-robot systems,</li>
          <li>relevant techniques in knowledge representation and reasoning,</li>
          <li>a specific application domain in which planning and scheduling problems arise,</li>
          <li>search algorithms or heuristic families.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We encourage tutorials that (i) include a hands-on session that can be completed
          remotely or asynchronously, allowing participants to experiment with useful
          tools, or (ii) experiment with algorithmic components, to deepen the
          participants' understanding of the topic. We especially welcome tutorials that
          collaborate with a workshop, such that the tutorial provides some introductory
          material that can be later discussed at the workshop.</p>


        <h3>Tutorial Proposals</h3>

        <p>Tutorial Submissions should include the tutorial's title, type (advanced or
          introductory), summary, outline, and expected length (half-day or quarter-day)
          as well as a short CV of the proposer(s), including a list of significant
          publications and/or prior tutorial experience. The proposal should not exceed
          two pages.</p>

        <p>Tutorial proposals should be submitted by email, in PDF, to both Tutorial
          Chairs with subject "Tutorial Proposal for ICAPS-22" no later than March 1st.
          Organizers of tutorials will be notified by email of the acceptance or rejection
          of their proposal by March 18th.</p>
